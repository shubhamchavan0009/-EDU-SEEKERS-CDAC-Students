Our project, Edu-Seeker web application, aims to address the common
challenges faced by CDAC students, such as finding suitable hostels, mess services,
healthcare facilities, and electronic gadget shops. With our platform, students can
conveniently access all these basic amenities in one place, saving them time, money, and
effort. The application utilizes React for the frontend, Spring Boot for the backend, and
MySQL for the database.
